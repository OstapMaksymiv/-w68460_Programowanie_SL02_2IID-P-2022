        <li><i>Either/Or by Elif Batuman</i></li>
        <img src="EitherOr.webp" alt="" width="450" height="300">
        <p width="10" height="3000">Elif Batuman returned this year with a sequel to The Idiot, which was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. This time around, the precocious and endearing Selin—who knows she will be a novelist, but isn’t quite sure how—becomes the author of her own story. The year is 1996, and Selin finds herself in her sophomore year at Harvard, freshly armed with a prescription for antidepressants. It’s here that the linguistics student distills exactly what happened last summer, tries to figure out who she wants to be, and travels to Turkey—all to the soundtrack of her favorites: Fiona Apple and Lauryn Hill. —Laura Zornosa</p>
        <li><i>Still Life by Jay Hopler</i></li>
        <img src="StillLife.webp" alt="" width="450" height="300">
        <p width="10" height="3000">In the wake of a terminal cancer diagnosis, poet Jay Hopler pondered his own mortality with wit, searing insight, and a clear-eyed sense of courage in his third and final poetry collection, Still Life. Longlisted for a National Book Award and published just two months before his death in June, the collection is a bittersweet triumph. Hopler confronts his fears—big and small, real and imagined—in a magnificent demonstration of the strength of the heart. —Cady Lang</p>
        
        <li><i>The Marriage Portrait by Maggie O’Farrell</i></li>
        <img src="TheMarriagePortait.webp" alt="" width="450" height="300">
        <p width="10" height="3000">In the opening sentences of The Marriage Portrait, Maggie O’Farrell reveals that the protagonist—a teenage girl in late-Renaissance Italy—will be dead in less than a year, likely at her husband’s hand. Lucrezia, who’s 15 at the time of her arranged marriage to a duke, is hit with an eerie premonition about her fate, and begins to observe her husband, carefully noting the circumstances that will lead to her death. The novel—which follows O’Farrell’s 2020 hit Hamnet—shines with historic detail and elegant prose. —Angela Haupt</p>
